        <h2>Art is a Harmony <span><br>Parellel with Nature!</span></h2>
        <p>That gives us a lot to work with! Nature is both all around us and deep within us. We are inseparable from nature - our bodies, lives and minds depend on the air we breathe and the food we eat. The earth sustains our very life force. Without the earth - without nature - what would we be?

            Artwork based on nature can take many forms and serve many purposes. Because "nature" is such an immense topic that encompasses so many things, I can only provide a partial list of the various subtopics that may appear in nature-related artwork
            Nature in art can take many visual forms, from photorealism to abstraction. Art can mimic nature, by seeking to visually replicate objects as they actually appear in real life. But abstract paintings can also take their visual cue from actual forms in nature, such as the painting below. This piece arose from the study, observation, and contemplation of natural phenomena and natural forms. When sitting at
             the easel, I used creative liberties to assign bright colors to detailed patterns that were inspired by what I had seen in my natural surroundings.</p>
